This is a complete remake, and yet, using ANY constraints other than allowing auto-layout to run 
automatically (add missing constraints) results in the second label not appearing. Only a third 
label (sans constraints) will show. Go figure. At least I got in some practice, which was needed, 
as the prior project was totally hacked from the XML given as an example (which took some doing, 
and, I would not have done it had Xcode not refused to allow me to drag a cell onto the scrollView)
... because, I had fed her so much crap that I actually broke her and was force to put her down, 
and then had to go out and get myself a brand-new-girl -- which always takes longer than you ... 
expect, but it was another learning experience I will have the opportunity to mostly forget:-?
